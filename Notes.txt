Will split the job into 3 files to load and train the data, 
create the neurl network architecture, and to test.



Load Data 
    - Will load the data in and use pytorch to normalize the data
      and create a dataset. The data needs to be rescaled, and 
      converted into tensors. Color could be useful so the 
      images will not be converted to grayscale.
